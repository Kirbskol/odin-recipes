# odin-recipes

This is my first project within the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.

Within this repo you will find:
- Home page (index.html) with links to specific recipes for different meal times. Swedish style!
- Recipes pages within Recipes folder, all with image, ingredients, and instructions!
- Images folder containing images relating to each recipe!

UPDATE 05/10/2024:
- CSS folder and file added, styling of website completed including coloring, and box elements.
- Home icon added whenever viewing recipe pages to bring user back to index.html

Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoy your Swedish meal! Tack!
